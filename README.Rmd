The goal of `whippr` is to provide a set of tools for manipulating gas exchange data from cardiopulmonary exercise testing.

## Why `whippr`?

The name of the package is in honor of [Prof. Brian J Whipp](https://erj.ersjournals.com/content/39/1/1) and his invaluable contribution to the field of exercise physiology.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `whippr` from [Github](https://github.com/fmmattioni/whippr) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("fmmattioni/whippr")
```

## Use

### Read data

```{r}
library(whippr)

## example file that comes with the package for demonstration purposes
path_example <- system.file("example_cosmed.xlsx", package = "whippr")

df <- read_data(path = path_example, metabolic_cart = "cosmed")

df
```

### Interpolate

```{r}
df %>% 
  interpolate()
```

### Perform averages

#### Bin-average

```{r}
## example of performing 30-s bin-averages
df %>% 
  interpolate() %>% 
  perform_average(type = "bin", bins = 30)
```

#### Rolling-average

```{r}
## example of performing 30-s rolling-averages
df %>% 
  interpolate() %>% 
  perform_average(type = "rolling", rolling_window = 30)
```

## Metabolic carts currently supported

* [COSMED](https://www.cosmed.com/en/)
* [CORTEX](https://cortex-medical.com/EN)
* [NSpire](https://www.pressebox.de/pressemitteilung/nspire-health-gmbh/ZAN-100-Diagnostische-Spirometrie/boxid/745555)

## Functions to be added

The package is still in its [experimental](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#experimental) phase, so do not hesitate to open any issues and/or suggest improvements.

- gas exchange threshold and respiratory compensation point detection
- outliers ("bad breaths") detection
