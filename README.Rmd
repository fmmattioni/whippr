The goal of `whippr` is to provide a set of tools for manipulating gas exchange data from cardiopulmonary exercise testing.

## Why `whippr`?

The name of the package is in honor of [Prof. Brian J Whipp](https://erj.ersjournals.com/content/39/1/1) and his invaluable contribution to the field of exercise physiology.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `whippr` from [Github](https://github.com/fmmattioni/whippr) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("fmmattioni/whippr")
```

## Use

### Read data

```{r}
library(whippr)

## example file that comes with the package for demonstration purposes
path_example <- system.file("example_cosmed.xlsx", package = "whippr")

df <- read_data(path = path_example, metabolic_cart = "cosmed")

df
```

### Interpolate

```{r}
df %>% 
  interpolate()
```

### Perform averages

#### Bin-average

```{r}
## example of performing 30-s bin-averages
df %>% 
  interpolate() %>% 
  perform_average(type = "bin", bins = 30)
```

#### Rolling-average

```{r}
## example of performing 30-s rolling-averages
df %>% 
  interpolate() %>% 
  perform_average(type = "rolling", rolling_window = 30)
```


### Perform VO2 kinetics analysis

```{r}
results_kinetics <- vo2_kinetics(
  .data = df,
  intensity_domain = "moderate",
  vo2_column = "VO2",
  protocol_n_transitions = 3,
  protocol_baseline_length = 360,
  protocol_transition_length = 360,
  cleaning_level = 0.95,
  cleaning_baseline_fit = c("linear", "exponential", "exponential"),
  fit_level = 0.95,
  fit_bin_average = 5,
  fit_phase_1_length = 20,
  fit_baseline_length = 120,
  fit_transition_length = 240,
  verbose = TRUE
)
```
